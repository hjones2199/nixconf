#+TITLE: Nix User Configuration
#+AUTHOR: hjones2199

* Information
This repo is my user-specific configuration of the nix package manager. To install
the package-set (assuming you have nix installed), clone the repo to *$HOME/.config/nixpkgs/*
create a *user-info.nix* file in the following format:

#+begin_src nix
  {
    unixName = "<unix user name>";
    homeDir = "<home directory>";
    fullName = "<full name>";
    userEmail = "<email address>";
  }
#+end_src

The configuration now requires home-manager to function.
